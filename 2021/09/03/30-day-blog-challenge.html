<h1 id="30-day-blog-challenge">30 Day Blog Challenge</h1>

<p>I am starting a 30 Day blog challenge for myself, I will be writing at end of each day for the next 30 days. I was thinking of blogging for years now, but now I will start writing at end of each day about my day to day learnings.</p>

<p>I will mostly write about the stuff related to Machine Learning, I will try to cover a new topic each day that I find interesting.</p>

<p>Here I will also be documenting my journey of PyTorch Book Reading Group. I have partcipated in that and plan to get more in-depth knowledge of PyTorch.</p>
